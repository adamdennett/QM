This week is focussed on defining research hypotheses, and using statistical tests to evaluate them. In particular we will use the Student's T-test, and the KS distribution test. 

## To add a callout-note

:::{.callout-note}

This practical follows on from practical 2, so if you haven't done that yet I suggest going back and working through that first!

## Loading the data 

We are going to look at schools perfomance data in England once again. 

The data is sourced from []() and is downloadable [here]().

We have saved a copy of this dataset to the Github repo, in case that the dataset is removed from the website.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as sps
import numpy as np 

# Read CSV file, handling common missing value entries
na_vals = ["", "NA", "SUPP", "NP", "NE", "SP", "SN", "SUPPMAT"]
df_ks4 = pd.read_csv(
    'L2_data/england_ks4final.csv',
    na_values = na_vals
)

info_cols = ['RECTYPE', 'LEA', 'SCHNAME', 'TOTPUPS', 'TOWN']
ebaccs_cols = ['EBACCAPS', 'EBACCAPS_GIRLS', 'EBACCAPS_BOYS']

df = df_ks4[info_cols + ebaccs_cols]

df[['TOTPUPS']+ebaccs_cols] = df[['TOTPUPS']+ebaccs_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')

df = df[df['RECTYPE'].isin([1, 2])].copy()

df.head()
```

Looking at the metadata (which you can see in 'L2_data/ks4_meta.xlsx') we can see the full meaning of each column header: 

- 'RECTYPE' = Record type (1=mainstream school; 2=special school; 4=local authority; 5=National (all schools); 7=National (maintained schools))
- 'LEA' = Local authority 
- 'SCHNAME' = School name 
- 'TOTPUPS' = Number of pupils on roll (all ages)
- 'TOWN' = School town 
- 'EBACCAPS' = Average EBacc APS score per pupil
- 'EBACCAPS_GIRLS' = Average EBacc APS score per girl
- 'EBACCAPS_BOYS' = Average EBacc APS score per boy

## Research question 

The department for education is worried about regional inequality in school grades. With this in mind they've come up with a research question they'd like to address. 

**Research question:** Is average pupil attainment on the EBacc significantly different in London compared to the rest of England? 

To do this we're going to use the mean comparison test to compare the schools in London to those outside of London. 

## Preparing the data 

### Splitting the groups 

```{python}
df_London = df[df['TOWN'] == 'London']
df_London = df_London[df_London['EBACCAPS'].notna()]

df_notLondon = df[df['TOWN'] != 'London']
df_notLondon = df_notLondon[df_notLondon['EBACCAPS'].notna()]
```

And lets look at the summary statistics for each group. 

```{python}
df_London['EBACCAPS'].describe()
```

```{python}
df_notLondon['EBACCAPS'].describe()
```

So from looking at their summary statistics the two groups are different sizes. The two groups also have different means - but we want to test if these means are statistically significantly different. 

## The hypothesis test 

We're now going to work through the steps of the hypothesis test according to the five steps discussed in the lecture: 

1. Define the null and alternative hypothesis
2. Set you significance level
3. Identify the evidence
4. Calculate the p-value
5. Compare p-value with hypothesis level

### Step 1

What is the null and alternative hypothesis? 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
H_0 = '??'
H_1 = '??'

print(f'The null hypothesis is {H_0}')
print(f'The alternative hypothesis is {H_1}')
```

#### Answer

```{python}
H_0 = 'Mean EBacc score in London = Mean EBacc score outside London'
H_1 = 'Mean EBacc score in London > Mean EBacc score outside London OR Mean EBacc score in London < Mean EBacc score outside London'

print(f'The null hypothesis is {H_0}')
print(f'The alternative hypothesis is {H_1}')
```
:::

### Step 2 

```{python}
# Set the level of statistical significance 

alpha = 0.05
```

### Step 3 

We already have the evidence - it's our datasets `df_London['EBACCAPS']` and `df_notLondon['EBACCAPS']`. 

### Step 4 

We can use a built in function from `scipy.stats` called `ttest_ind` to do step 4 for us. You can read more about this function [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html). 

First we need to check whether we can assume that the samples are drawn from populations with the same standard deviation or not. (Provided neither standard deviation is double the other, this should be ok). 

```{python}
London_std = df_London['EBACCAPS'].mean()
notLondon_std = df_notLondon['EBACCAPS'].mean()

# Calculate the ratio of standard deviations 
std_ratio = London_std/notLondon_std

print("std ratio =", std_ratio)

if std_ratio > 0.5 and std_ratio < 2:
    print("Can assume equal population standard deviations.")
    equal_stds = True
else:
    print("Cannot assume equal population standard deviations.")
    equal_stds = False
```

There are two outputs from the function `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`: the **test statistic** and the **p value**. 

```{python}
test_stat, p_value = sps.ttest_ind(df_London['EBACCAPS'], df_notLondon['EBACCAPS'], equal_var = equal_stds)

print("test statistic = ", test_stat)
print("p-value =", p_value)
```

### Step 5 

For the final step we compare the p-value to the significance value in order to reach a decision. 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
if p_value ?? ?? :
    print(f"Reject the null hypothesis ({H_0}). Accept the alternative hypothesis ({H_1}).")
    print("Conclude that samples are drawn from populations with different means.")
elif p_value ?? ?? :
    print(f"No significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis ({H_0}).")
    print("Assume samples are drawn from populations with the same mean.")
```

#### Answer

```{python}
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject the null hypothesis ({H_0}). Accept the alternative hypothesis ({H_1}).")
    print("Conclude that samples are drawn from populations with different means.")
elif p_value >= alpha:
    print(f"No significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis ({H_0}).")
    print("Assume samples are drawn from populations with the same mean.")
```
:::

Hence we can conclude that the evidence supports there is a statistically significant differnece between the mean student attainment on the EBacc in London, versus outside of London. 

## A more complicated research question

Now I'd like to know, are the EBacc scores for boys and girls in England distributed simiarly? 

In the dataset we have the average EBacc score for each school split by gender. To address whether these two samples come from the same distribution we're going to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test. 

## Preparing the data 

### Summary statistics

Let's start by looking at the summary statistics. 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
df[[??]].??
```

#### Answer

```{python}
df[['EBACCAPS_GIRLS', 'EBACCAPS_BOYS']].describe()
```
:::

### Plotting the data 

Let's also visually inspect the data. 

```{python}
plt.hist(df['EBACCAPS_GIRLS'], bins=20, color='#abc766', alpha=0.5, label='Girls')
plt.hist(df['EBACCAPS_BOYS'], bins=20, color='#4e3c56', alpha=0.5, label='Boys')
plt.xlim(0,9) # the EBacc has a maximum score of 9
plt.xlabel('EBacc Score')
plt.ylabel('Number of Schools')
plt.title('Distribution of EBacc Scores')
plt.legend()

plt.show()
```

From visually looking at the plot we can see that the two distributions look quite similar - but let's formally test that. As before, we're going to follow the five steps of hypothesis testing. 

### Step 1

What is the null and alternative hypothesis? 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
H_0 = '??'
H_1 = '??'

print(f'The null hypothesis is {H_0}')
print(f'The alternative hypothesis is {H_1}')
```

#### Answer

```{python}
H_0 = 'Mean EBacc score for Girls is drawn from the same distribution as the mean EBacc score for Boys.'
H_1 = 'Mean EBacc score for Girls is drawn from a different distirbution to the mean EBacc score for Boys.'

print(f'The null hypothesis is {H_0}')
print(f'The alternative hypothesis is {H_1}')
```
:::

### Step 2 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
# Set the level of statistical significance 

alpha = ??
```

#### Answer

```{python}
# Set the level of statistical significance 

alpha = 0.05
```
:::

### Step 3 

We already have the evidence - it's our datasets `df['EBACCAPS_GIRLS']` and `df['EBACCAPS_BOYS']`. 

### Step 4 NOTE: got to here 

We can use a built in function from `scipy.stats` called `ks_2samp` to do step 4 for us. You can read more about this function [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ks_2samp.html). 

There are two outputs from the function `scipy.stats.ks_2samp`: the **test statistic** and the **p value**. 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
ks_stat, ks_p_value = ?? 

print("KS test statistic = ", ks_stat)
print("KS p-value =", ks_p_value)
```

#### Answer

```{python}
ks_stat, ks_p_value = sps.ks_2samp(df['EBACCAPS_GIRLS'].notna(), df['EBACCAPS_BOYS'].notna()) 

print("KS test statistic = ", ks_stat)
print("KS p-value =", ks_p_value)
```
:::

### Step 5 

For the final step we compare the p-value to the significance value in order to reach a decision. 

::: qna
#### Question

``` python
if ??
    print(??)
else ?? 
    print(??)
```

#### Answer

```{python}
if ks_p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject the null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from the same distribution.")
    print("Conclude that samples are drawn from populations with different distributions.")
else: 
    print(f"Fail to reject the null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from the same distribution.")
    print("Assume that samples are drawn from populations with the same distribution.")
```

## Extension 
If you've finished working through the examples in the tutorial then have a go at coming up with your own research question and hypothesis. 

A good place to start would be by looking at the data in `df_ks4` - theres a lot of numerical information here - are there two variables you could compare? 

```{python}
df_ks4.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20, 15))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


## You're Done!

Well done you've completed this weeks practical on establishing and evaluating hypothesis questions. If you are still working on it, take your time. And if you have any questions just ask!
