This week's practical is focussed on understanding regression analysis in an applied context. You will essentially re-create some of the analysis you saw in the lecture, but for slightly different variables and for different places.

::: callout-note
Below you will find code-blocks that will allow you to run your analysis in either R or Python. It's up to you which you decide to use - you might even want to try both to compare (Of course, R will be better)!
:::

## Tasks

Make sure you complete each of the tasks below, 1-7. All of these will be covered in the code examples below, but this is the full [workflow](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/workflow):

### Downloading: Download and read data into your software environment:

1.  School locational and attribute information, downloaded from here - <https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Downloads> - or read it in using the code supplied below. This will include the following datasets:

    a.  **edubase_schools** = this is the 'all establishment' data for every school in England and Wales

2.  School-level Key Stage 4 (14-16 GCSE level) attainment and other attribute information. [I have put this on Moodle here](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=8199904), but it can also be downloaded from here - <https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/download-data>.

    Download to a local drive on your computer from Moodle, unzip it and then read it in using the code supplied below. The zip folders contain the following data files in one folder and the associated metadata in the other folder:

    b.  **england_ks4final** = data on the 2022/23 academic year, school-level, KS4 outcomes and associated statistics
    c.  **england_abs** = data on the 2022/23 academic year, school-level absence rates
    d.  **england_census** = additional school-level pupil information for the 2022/23 academic year
    e.  **england_school_information** = additional school-level institution information such as Ofsted rating etc. for the 2022/23 academic year
    f.  **england_ks4_pupdest** = pupil destination data (where students go once they leave school at 16)

### Data Munging: Join, filter and select:

3.  Create a master file for Englandcalled **england_school_2022_23.** This will be made by joining together all of the school-level data above into a single file and then reducing it in size using:
    a.  **filter** - so that it just contains open secondary schools
    b.  **select** - so that only a few key variables relating to attainment, progress, deprivation, absence and school quality remain, alongside key locational and other attributes.
4.  Create two local authority data **subsets** from this main file:
    a.  A subset containing all of the secondary schools in one of the 32 London Boroughs (not including the City of London)
    b.  A subset containing all of the secondary schools in any other local authority in England. Any local authority you like - go wild!

At the end of this you will have **x3 datasets** - one national and two local authority subsets

### Exploratory Data Analysis

5.  Choose:
    a.  one attainment related dependent variable from your set
    b.  one possible explanatory variable which you think might help explain levels of attainment in schools
6.  Create a series of graphs and statistical outputs to allow you to understand the structure and composition of your data. You should produce:
    a.  A histogram for the dependent and independent variables you are analysing for **both your two subsets** and the **national dataset** (x6 histograms in total). Also include:
        i.  mean and median lines
        ii. lines for the upper and lower quartiles
        iii. indications of outliners
        iv. a kernel density smoothing
    b.  Alternative plots such as violin plots or box plots to compare with the histogram
    c.  Point Maps of the locations of your schools in your two subsets - points sized by either of your variables
    d.  A scatter plot of your dependent (attainment) and independent (disadvantage) variables (national and two local subsets)
        i.  include a regression line of best fit
        ii. include the R-squared, slope and intercept parameters

### Explanatory Data Analysis - Attainment and Factors Affecting it in Different Parts of England

7.  Carry out a bi-variate regression analysis to explore the relationship between your chosen attainment dependent variable and your single explanatory independent variable, for your two subsets and the national dataset. **Questions to Answer**:
    a.  After visualising the relationships using scatter plots, do you think you need to transform your variables (e.g. using a log transformation) before putting into a regression model? Maybe plot scatter plots of your logged variables too!
    b.  What are the slope and intercept coefficients in each model? Are they statistically significant and how do vary between your two subsets? How do they compare with the national picture?
    c.  How do the R-squared values differ and how reliable do you think they are (what do the degrees of freedom tell you)?
    d.  What observations can you make about your two local authority study areas relative to the national picture?

## Task 1 - Download your data and read into your software environment

-   I've made this task easy for you by giving you the code to download all of this data. You'll need to download - click on either tab to see the code for each.
-   You should first [download and unzip the data from Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=8199904), before editing the code below so that you can read the data from a local folder on your computer:

## Task 2 - Data Munging

-   Use Python or R to join all of the datasets you loaded in the previous step into a single master file that we will called `england_school_2022_23` using the unique school reference number (URN) as the key.
-   Create the master file:

# Left join england_ks4final with england_abs, census, and school information

```



-   Now have joined all of these data frames into a single master dataframe for the whole of England we will need to filter out some of the rows we don't want and the columns that we don't need for our analysis at this stage
-   In the two folders you downloaded from Moodle, one contains all of the data we need, the other contains all of the metadata which tells us what the variables are
-   If you open up, for example `ks4_meta.xlsx` these are the variables related to attainment for each school.
-   Similarly `abbreviations.xlsx` attaches some meaning to some of the codes associated with some of these variables, with other metadata files containing other info. Take some time to look at these so you understand the range of variables we'll be exploring.

**NB** - One of the key filtering asks carried out in the code below is to 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
#str(england_school_2022_23)
```

Other variables to include in your reduced dataset:

1.  Local Authority (LEA) Code and Name - **LEA** and **LANAME**
2.  Total Number of Pupils on Roll (all ages) - **TOTPUPS**
3.  Average Attainment 8 score per pupil for English element - **ATT8SCRENG**
4.  Average Attainment 8 score per pupil for mathematics element - **ATT8SCRMAT**
5.  Average Attainment 8 score per disadvantaged pupil - **ATT8SCR_FSM6CLA1A**

7.  Average Attainment 8 score per boy - **ATT8SCR_BOYS**
8.  Average Attainment 8 score per girl - **ATT8SCR_GIRLS**
9.  Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores - **P8MEA**
10. Adjusted Progress 8 measure - disadvantaged pupils - **P8MEA_FSM6CLA1A**

21. Percentage of overall absence - **PERCTOT**
22. Percentage of enrolments who are persistent absentees - **PPERSABS10**
23. School Type e.g. Voluntary Aided school - **SCHOOLTYPE**
24. Religious character - **RELCHAR**
25. Admissions Policy - **ADMPOL**
26. Government Office Region Name - **gor_name**
27. Mixed of Single Sex - **gender_name**

**NB** - When you joined your datasets earlier, you will find that some variables appear in more than one of the datasets. This may cause a problem now as R and Python will try and distinguish them in the join by appending a `.x` or `.y` (R) or `_x` or `_y` (Python) so you may get an error when joining, particularly with the **SCHOOLTYPE** and **ADMPOL** variables. For these try **SCHOOLTYPE.x** and **ADMPOL.y** (underscore for Python) instead.

Subsetting

Now you have created your main analysis file, you could create two Local Authority Subsets to analyse:

1. A Local Authority (Borough) of your choice from London
2. A LOcal Authorit of your choice from anywhere else in England
